### Execute From Source Code

Get the Processing Development Environment (PDE) either on [Processing's website](https://processing.org/download/), 
or use a package manager like [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run

```bash
$ brew cask install processing
```

After installing, open PDE, clone this repo and open `sweetbunny.pde` from PDE, and click the run button on the top left corner.

## Source Code

There are two source code files, [sweetbunny.pde](./sweetbunny.pde) and [sweetbunny.java](./sweetbunny.java). The later is
generated by PDE.

## About the Processing Programming Language

The Processing language builds on the Java language[1]. The syntax is Java-like. Go to their [website](https://processing.org/) or [GitHub repo](https://github.com/processing/processing)
if you are interested.
